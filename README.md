## Overview
Trims Reimagined takes vanilla minecraft trims and adds themed effects for having the trims on your armor. Each type of trim has a specific effect that stacks as more of that same trim are worn, and if a full set of armor with the same trims on it are worn, ie. 4 pieces of diamond armor all with the silence trim added, an extra set bonus will be added ontop of the existing effects. Trims can be mixed and matched to created different combinations of effects and bonuses.
This mod aims to make trims more desirable for different parts of the game, and encourages exploration and the use of multiple armor sets. Trims are cool, but adding effects gives a reason to explore different parts of the world.
The trim effects can be toggled with a keybind if you prefer to just have the looks of a certain trim, and not the effects.
For each trim, mousing over the trim or armor with trim applied will have a quick explanation of the effects and set bonuses each trim provides.

## Technical Overview
This mod uses mixins to edit the vanilla code of minecraft to allow for trims to add effects.
By no means is this an optimised mod, and due to the way mixins are written, they may cause crashes with other mods.

## Conflicts
No conflicts are expected. As long as modded armor supports adding trims, the effects should be granted. Obviously will not support mods that add new trims.

## Planned Features
Some speed effects are a little jarring when high FOV is used, so I may disable the FOV changes for that speed effect.
Some bonuses may be too powerful, but feedback will help determine what needs a nerf and what needs buffs.
